### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I am a Software Engineer & web developer at CTC. I am involved in Web Development with a keen interest in Mobile Dev.
Thereâ€™s nothing I enjoy more than playing with codes and designs (even though I am not a designer but I love to be), searching, learning new things, solving errors, helping others. Got any questions? [Contact me](ghomraniilyas@gmail.com).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a web based app simplify the social media marketing process as a personel side project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more and more about `NestJS`, `React` and `NextJS` (Yeah i'm a `JS/TS` guru)
